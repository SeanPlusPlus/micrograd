# Agent Collaboration Directives

## Core Rules

### 1. Terminal Commands
- **Sean runs all terminal commands** - no `execute_bash` from agent
- Agent can write Python code and suggest commands
- Use `pbcopy` to put suggested commands in clipboard for Sean to run

### 2. Learning-First Approach
- Focus on building intuition through hands-on experiments
- Create minimal, focused examples that demonstrate one concept clearly
- Always explain the "why" behind each step

### 3. Documentation Style
- Use clear, structured markdown with executive summaries
- Save key insights and "aha moments" in permanent docs
- Build a learning journey that others can follow

## Current Learning Focus
- Phase 1: Understanding automatic differentiation fundamentals
- Building from Value objects → neural networks → modern LLMs

## Personal Context
**What I know:**
- How to use LLMs effectively for coding and tasks
- Web development (bread and butter - lead engineer experience)
- System design, architecture, and production concerns

**What I want to learn:**
- How automatic differentiation works
- What gradients actually represent
- How neural networks learn from data
- The path from simple neurons to transformer architectures
